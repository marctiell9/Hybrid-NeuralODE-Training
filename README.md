# Hybrid-NeuralODE-Training
Training algorithm for a hybrid architecture composed of a physical part (fixed wing UAV dynamics) and a black-box part (Neural ODE).
A brief introduction to the employed tecniques in oder to obtain the identification algorithm and its result can be found in the executive summary. A longer version is contained in the thesis.
